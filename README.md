# Proposer

Proposer provides a simple API to request permission for access Camera, Photos, Microphone, Contacts, Location.

## Requirements

Swift 1.2, iOS 8.0

## Example

Only one single API:

```swift
proposeToAccess(:agreed:rejected:)
```

In real world:

```swift
import Proposer
```

```swift
@IBAction func choosePhoto() {

    let photos: PrivateResource = .Photos

    proposeToAccess(photos, agreed: {
        if UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable(UIImagePickerControllerSourceType.SavedPhotosAlbum) {
            let imagePicker = UIImagePickerController()
            imagePicker.sourceType = .SavedPhotosAlbum

            self.presentViewController(imagePicker, animated: true, completion: nil)
        }

    }, rejected: {
        self.alertNoPermissionToAccess(photos)
    })
}
```

When you want to get user's location, thanks to Swift's enum, you can even choose the usage mode:

```swift
@IBAction func shareLocation() {

    let location: PrivateResource = .Location(.WhenInUse)
    
    proposeToAccess(location, agreed: {
        print("I can access Location. :]\n")
        
    }, rejected: {
        self.alertNoPermissionToAccess(location)
    })
}
```

Depending on your needs, you must add a `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` or `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` to your Info.plist

See the demo for more information.

I recommend you add a `UIViewController+Proposer.swift` file (like the demo) for show localized alert before the first proposal or when propose failed.

## Installation

Feel free to drag `Proposer.swift` to your iOS Project. Or use CocoaPods.

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects.

CocoaPods 0.36 adds supports for Swift and embedded frameworks. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate Proposer into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '8.0'

pod 'Proposer', '~> 0.6'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

You should open the `{Project}.xcworkspace` instead of the `{Project}.xcodeproj` after you installed anything from CocoaPods.

For more information about how to use CocoaPods, I suggest [this tutorial](http://www.raywenderlich.com/64546/introduction-to-cocoapods-2).
